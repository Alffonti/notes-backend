# notes-backend

Node is used for the backend of the application.

The express library was installed to build a backend server.

The nodemon package was installed to automatically restart the application everytime a file changes.

The Visual Studio Code REST client plugin was installed to test the HTTP requests. A `requests` directory at the root of the backend application was added containing REST client requests as files ending with the .rest extension.
