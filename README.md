# notes-backend

Node is used for the backend of the application.

The express library was installed to build a backend server.

The nodemon package was installed to automatically restart the application everytime a file changes.

The Visual Studio Code REST client plugin was installed to test the HTTP requests. A `requests` directory at the root of the backend application was added containing REST client requests as files ending with the .rest extension.

The static middleware is used to serve the static files (production build of the frontend) from the backend.
